This repository contains the biggest part of my work during my studies towards
the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Babeș-Bolyai University. I tried my
very best to let the files unaltered and in their initial form, by letting the
code as it was, while bringing slight modifications to some file naming to highlight
better the topic. Throughout this repository, one can view my progress as a developer,
the way my code improved and also the multitude of tasks I had to do for various subjects.
